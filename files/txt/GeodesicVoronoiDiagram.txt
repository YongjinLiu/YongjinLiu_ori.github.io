===============================================================
This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful. It contains features 
including geodesic line and voronoi diagram.

This program is coded using Qt + OpenGL in visual studio 2010. Qt runtime libaray is 
shipped with the program. You may need to install OpenGL and visual studio 2010 
redistribution if your computer has not installed.

1. Basic operation
  Rotate: left mouse button
  Scale: wheel or Ctrl + left mouse button
  Picking: pick vertex on the mesh with Shift key is pressed. Then click mouse right 
button, select "Set as exact geodesic source" or "Set as exact geodesic Destination" 
or "Set as Voronoi source", etc.

2. Geodesic related
  For geodesic line, you need to pick a vertex as source, then perform build distance 
field. After built distance field, you can pick as vertex as destination, then build 
geodesic line.
  
 For voronoi diagram, you need to pick several vertices as source(at least 2), then 
perform build voronoi diagram.

Notes:
  All the operation releated with geodesic line and voronoi diagram are in geodesic 
menu and popup menu. The function of items in those two menu can be easily infered 
according to its name. 

  This program only supports mesh with obj format. Please see the test data in the 
package.

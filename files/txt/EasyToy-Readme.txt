Recommended Configuration:  1GMemory, 2.8GHz CPU, 256M Graphics Card 


Functionality:
EasyToy is a 3D cartoon modeling software. It uses a sketch-based modeling method and 
a 3D painting method. The user interface is very friendly and operations are very simple. 
A complex 3D model can be created quickly by combining several simple operations . 
Compared with comprehensive WMIP (window, icon, menu, pointing device) 3D systems, 
EasyToy is easy-to-learn and easy-to-use. EasyToy has wide applications, including toy 
design, graphics, animation and education. It is not only suitable for toy designers to 
design toys and CG creators to design 3D avatars, but also for novice users, especially 
children, to design 3D cartoon.

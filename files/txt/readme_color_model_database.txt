This database contains 431 3D color models, which were classified into
17 classes. The classification information can be found at document
"Database_contents.pdf".

All the 3D color models can be browsed in 3D using the software 
"ColorModelViewer.exe"

Some retrieval performance (not use the full database) can be found at

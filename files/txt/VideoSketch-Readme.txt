Android operation system

Functionality:
VideoSketch is a smart and novel application for annotating video using freeform sketches 
intuitively and efficiently. With a few tappings, you can integrate your thoughts and your 
notes into the video, and double click leads to generating your sketch indexes. It's 
convenient to add notes quickly especially when you go out for travelling. You can browse, 
locate and search video content by those sketches with ease.
